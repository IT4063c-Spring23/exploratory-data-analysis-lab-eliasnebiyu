# Exploratory Data Analysis - Lab

## Introduction
The lab is designed to be self-guided, providing solutions for each exercise to check your work and assist if you get stuck. However, it is important to first attempt to solve the problem on your own as this is the best way to learn. If you become stuck, don't give up and seek help from the instructor, peers, or even a search engine like Google. Be mindful that not all answers from a search engine may be correct, so use your judgement to determine the validity of the information. Remember, the best way to learn is to try solving the problem yourself first.

This lab is designed to help you practice exploratory data analysis using Python. You will work with one dataset: auto-mpg. You will use various data visualization and analysis techniques to gain insights and identify patterns in the data, and clean and preprocess the data to make it more suitable for analysis.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lab, you should be able to:

- Load and preprocess data using Python libraries such as pandas
- Clean and preprocess the data to make it more suitable for analysis
- Use visualization techniques to explore and understand the distribution of the variables in the data
- Apply basic statistical analysis to derive insights from the data
- Communicate your findings through clear and effective data visualizations and summaries
